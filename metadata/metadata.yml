name: MNet (Mergenet) a framework to reduce fruit image misclassification using pre-trained
  models
description: 'Fast and accurate fruit classification is a major problem in the farming
  business. To achieve the same, the most popular technique used to build a classification
  model is “Transfer Learning”, in which the weights of pretrained models are used
  in a new model to solve different but related problems. This work proposed a novel
  framework called “MNet: Merged Net” which not only improves the accuracy, but also
  addresses the misclassification problem. In this framework, the fruit classification
  problem is divided into small problems and build a separate model for each. In the
  final stage, the results of these models are combined. Two models called as FC_InceptionV3
  (Fruit Classification InceptionV3) and MFC_InceptionV3 (Merged Fruit Classification
  InceptionV3) are created based on popular pretrained model InceptionV3. MFC_InceptionV3
  is based on proposed framework.'
